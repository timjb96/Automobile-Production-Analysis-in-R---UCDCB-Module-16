# Module_16_Challenge
For this module, we used production data regarding a prototype vehicle, the MechaCar, from AutosRUs, to analyze issues with the prototypes, and investigate what improvements need to be made. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Our first step was to produce a Linear Regression with some of the data, to predict MPG of the different production lots. This yielded the following:

> Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

> Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

> Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
